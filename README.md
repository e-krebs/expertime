# expertime

Here are presented the repositories I worked on for [expertime](https://github.com/expertime), the company I'm currently working at.

Rather than forking them identicaly, they are presented here.


## Web: javaScript / C# .net
- [Debug Sharepoint Javascript Sources](
https://github.com/Expertime/debug-sharepoint-javascript-sources)

> This chrome extension gives access to the debug-version of the SharePoint Javascript source files

I only rewrote this extension


- [Samples browser extensions](https://github.com/Expertime/samples-browser-extensions)

> The purpose of this repository is to offer basic samples browser extensions

I worked on these basic samples in order to present 'browser extensions' in an internal seminar


- [PWA](https://github.com/Expertime/PWA)

> This repository consists of 2 projects : a Progressive Web App (pure html/css/javascript) and the API (.net, C#) it is relying on.

This one was done to demonstrate in an internal seminar what PWA can do


## PowerShell
- [Run PowerShell as Admin](https://github.com/Expertime/run-powershell-as-admin)

> run a powershell script as admin (with arguments)

This one was done for a client's need : running a script 'As administrator' through Microsoft Realese Management 2013.


## Other
- [Windows PrivateNetwork plugin for cordova](https://github.com/Expertime/cordova-plugin-winPrivateNetwork)

> Add privateNetworkClientServer capabilities to a windows UWP+Cordova app

This one was done for a client's need.

It allows to perform request on a local network through a firewall in a Windows 10 cordova app.
I found the solution on msdn and/or stackoverflow, but no one took time to do an actual plugin out of it, however simple.

This was an interesting exercise since it made me do both my first official npm and cordova plugin.


So, there it is !
